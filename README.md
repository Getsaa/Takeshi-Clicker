# ![Takeshi Clicker](assets/images/readmeIcon.png)

A random clicker game I made for fun. It's not very good, but it's fun to play, i guess...

## Controls
- Left click or space to click
- Tab to switch between the cube and Takeshi
- WASD or arrow keys to move the character

## Misc Controls
- F1 to take a screenshot
- F2 to open the screenshot folder
- F4 to toggle fullscreen

- 1/2 to change the speed
- 3 to restore the character's position
- 4 to save the game

## Info
There's a save file and a time file in the saves folder. You can delete them if you want to start over.

(Also, don't take this game seriously. It's just a random clicker game I made for fun lol)
